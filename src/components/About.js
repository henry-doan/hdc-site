        My name Henry Doan I am the fastest coder alive <span role='img' aria-label='laptop'>ðŸ’»</span>! ... well, 
        I'm getting there. But welcome to my YouTube videos page, an ongoing project to showcase 
        my latest programming concepts and tutorials. I started to make videos as a resource with 
        a twist of explaining things. A bit about me is that I have taken quite a few programming 
        classes and got some certificates and degrees <span role='img' aria-label='cap'>ðŸŽ“</span> but the most that 
        I ever learn and grew was by attending a coding boot camp <span role='img' aria-label='boot'>ðŸ¥¾</span> from 
        DevPoint Labs where I got to found my calling in web development and education and ended up 
        working for them for a few years up until now, developing projects and teaching classes. With 
        all my knowledge and experience <span role='img' aria-label='brain'>ðŸ§ </span>, I am now proficient to create content 
        to share my knowledge with the world <span role='img' aria-label='erath'>ðŸŒŽ</span>! 
        <br />
        Enjoy!
