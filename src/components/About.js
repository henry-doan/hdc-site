    My name Henry Doan I am the fastest coder alive ðŸ’»! ... well, I'm getting there. But welcome to my YouTube videos page, an ongoing project to showcase my latest programming concepts and tutorials. I started to make videos as a resource with a twist of explaining things. A bit about me is that I have taken quite a few programming classes and got some certificates and degrees ðŸŽ“ but the most that I ever learn and grew was by attending a coding boot camp ðŸ¥¾ from DevPoint Labs where I got to found my calling in web development and education and ended up working for them for a few years up until now, developing projects and teaching classes. With all my knowledge and experience ðŸ§ , I am now proficient to create content to share my knowledge with the world ðŸŒŽ! 
    <br />
    Enjoy!
